  - Cell
  - Manfred wakes up in a padded cell without any memory how he got there. With him
    is Dr. Artie Cee, who is absolutely convinced that Manfred is insane and needs
    professional help. But will Manfred cooperate?
  - Corridor

    the corridor he has to choose whether he wants to take the direct route through
    the lobby or if he wants to try his luck in the cellar.
  - Cellar
  - A hamster turns out to be the only living being in the cellar. The way back is
    closed, so Manfred needs to be "creative" to escape the looney bin.
  - The End

  - Ah, you're recovering from the anaesthesia. How are you feeling?
  - 
  - confused
  - I'm not sure... I'm a bit dizzy... Is it just me or is the perspective of this
    room somehow incorrect?
  - 
  - 
  - Just the usual side-effect of the narcotic.
  - 
  - 
  - Where am I?
  - 
  - 
  - Interesting. It seems you lost your memory. Well, nothing to worry about.
  - 
  - 
  - You are in the "Lucas Artsington Sanitarium for the mentally disordered".
  - I'm in a looney bin?
  - 
  - Whoa, wait a second, are you telling me I'm in a looney bin?
  - 
  - 
  - Well, I would use a different term, but basically yes. You admitted yourself to
    flee from something you called "uncontrollable interactivity".
  - 
  - 
  - But you're in good hands, trust me. With my patented thought organizing therapy
    we'll have everything under control.
  - 
  - 
  - Okay, you think I'm insane... But you are wrong, doctor! I'm absolutely fine.
  - 
  - 
  - So, would you be so kind to show me the way out?
  - 
  - 
  - No offense, but I'm the one who decides who is a maddish lunatic and who is not.
    And your case definitely needs further investigation before we can confirm a diagnosis.
  - 
  - 
  - 'Oh my dear, you''re recovering from the anaesthesia. How are you feeling? '
  - What happened?
  - 
  - Anaesthesia? What the hell happened?
  - I feel dizzy.
  - 
  - I'm not sure... I'm a bit dizzy... Is it just me or is the perspective of this
    room somehow incorrect?
  - 
  - 
  - Interesting. It seems you lost your memory. Well, nothing to worry about.
  -

  -

  - I'm in a looney bin?
  - 
  - Whoa, wait a second, are you telling me I'm in a looney bin?
  - I lost my memory?
  - 
  - I lost my memory? That's definitely something I worry about!
  - I'm absolutely sane!
  - 
  - Okay, you think I'm insane... But you are wrong, doctor! I'm absolutely fine.
  - 
  - 
  - Well, I would use a different term, but basically yes. You admitted yourself to
    flee from something you called "uncontrollable interactivity".
  - 
  - 
  - Nothing we can't fix. Just needs some more sessions full of questions, hypnosis
    and perhaps a little brain surgery... and soon all your awful memories will return.
  - 
  - 
  - You tried to tame the "beast of non-linearity" with post-it notes on the wall.
    At first it seemed to work, but then... one of your notes fell down and you had
    a complete breakdown.
  - 
  - 
  - So, would you be so kind to show me the way out?
  - 
  - 
  - No offense, but I'm the one who decides who is a maddish lunatic and who is not.
    And your case definitely needs further investigation before we can confirm a diagnosis.
  - I'm right back.
  - 
  - Wait a moment, I'm right back to explain to you why I'm NOT crazy!
  - 
  - 
  - Ok, I have the key. Let's get out of here!
  - Let me convince you!
  - 
  - Well, think about it. One is insane, if one does crazy things, right?
  - 
  - 
  - Ah, my favorite weirdo. Do you want to continue the therapy?
  - 
  - 
  - I somehow feel bad... but he was really annoying, right?
  - 
  - 
  - But you're in good hands, trust me. With my patented thought organizing therapy
    we'll have everything under control.
  - 
  - 
  - To do crazy things you have to be really crazy, right? To diagnose that somebody
    is crazy, you actually have to see him do crazy things, right?
  - 
  - 
  - And even if somebody does something crazy but no one is there to see it, you have
    to assume that it never happened, right?
  - 
  - 
  - So a high profiled scientist like you has to reason that if I'm not doing anything
    crazy right now, then I'm neither crazy nor insane, right? And then you have to
    let me go, right?
  - 
  - 
  - I guess...
  - 
  - 
  - So, you have to let me go, right?
  - 
  - 
  - Will you stop saying "right"?
  - 'No

'
  - 
  - No.
  - 
  - 
  - Ok... I'll leave you now. The door will be open... it's up to you to, if you want
    to stay and get help or if you want to go and try your luck out there.
  - 
  - 
  - Well... that was easy.
  - 
  - 
  - In this case... no! It would be irresponsible to let you get in contact with society
    in your current state of mind.
  - 
  - 
  - '[turns around] At least you didn''t lose your sense of humor.'
  - 
  - 
  - Well, in case you want to go on with the therapy... just start banging on the
    door like a maniac. [leaves the cell]
  - 
  - 
  - Ah, I found a key! But I won't tell where I found it... believe me, you don't
    wanna know.
  - '*Search therapist*'
  - 
  - Well... looting time!
  - 
  - 
  - I searched him more than enough...
  - 
  - 
  - Oops... I slipped and dropped the crowbar, but the kind doctor catched it...
  - 
  - 
  - No, no, no. I don't want to disturb his slumber.
  - 
  - 
  - '...with his head. How lucky.'
  - 'The door is locked. '
  - 
  - The door is locked.
  - Let's see... [inspect door]
  - 
  - I guess I need a magic potion to shrink myself and escape through the keyhole...
    or I manage to get the key, but that sounds rather ridiculous.
  - 
  - 
  - Of course, I could fight my way out armed with nothing but an umbrella... I just
    don't want to.
  - 
  - 
  - Interesting. It seems the previous tenant of this cell has replaced the umbrella's
    hold with a crowbar... I better take that, before somebody gets hurt.
  - 
  - 
  - Hey you! Yes, I'm talking to YOU.
  - 
  - 
  - Where are you? Wait... you're not in my head, right? Otherwise I would have to
    reconsider my decision to leave this place...
  - 
  - 
  - Don't worry, I'm real! I'm down in the cellar.
  - 
  - 
  - Unfortunately I'm trapped down here... Please, help me out! I'm running out of
    water and nobody seems to care!
  - Could be a trap...
  - 
  - I don't know... could be a trap...
  - I'll rescue you!
  - 
  - I'll get you out, my fellow inmate! Together we'll escape this nightmare!
  - 
  - 
  - That socks!
  - 
  - 
  - I really hope they are just doing radium therapy down there...
  - 
  - 
  - This seems to be the shortest way out of here. But what if the front door is under
    surveillance?
  - 
  - 
  - Somebody down there seems to need my help... but what if it's a trap?
  - 
  - 
  - Dr. Mansion is selling his house for a maniac price! Call...

  - 'An ode to my best friend:


    I like you very much

    ''cause you are gentle to touch

    I build you a lair

    in which you stand and stare

    Sometimes I think it''s not fair

    that you''re just a hamster'
  - 
  - 
  - Nevigo... I guess that's the company that made the pinboard. I should write that
    down. Maybe I'll need a quality pinboard in the future.
  - 
  - 
  - Looks like I need to find another way out.
  - 
  - 
  - '*looks around* Nobody here but this cute little hamster. Could it be that...'
  - 
  -

    will very likely kill the hamster in its nearby cage...*'
  - '*turn to the hamster*'
  - 
  - Ok, my little furry friend...
  - I don't trust him.
  - 
  - I don't know... I simply don't trust that guy. He looks like he's planning something
    truly evil!
  - '*stare back*'

  - 
  - Ok, Mr. Hamster! Spit it out! Did YOU lure me into this trap?!

  - 
  - 
  - '*Somehow you manage to open the cage with the broom.*'
  - 
  - 
  - Ok, fellow. I put you in my pocket... but no nut-nibbling down there!
  - 
  - 
  - What are you holding there? Is that one of these designer letter openers I've
    heard so much of?
  - 
  - 
  - '*You try to grab the letter opener, but the cage is too high and the hamster
    seems to hold on to it very tight.*'
  - 
  - 
  - Thank you...
  - 
  - 
  - The cage is too high. I cannot open it from here.
  - 
  - 
  - I have what I need.
  - 
  - 
  - '*looks grateful*'
  - 
  - 
  - A chainsaw, gasoline for chainsaws only... aaaand... aluminium foil!
  - 
  - 
  - I don't have a chainsaw licence, so the aluminium foil will have to do the trick.
  - 
  - 
  - Nothing.

  - There's some kind of metal-like thing... but I can't reach it through the grid.
  - 
  - 
  - Not the best screwdriver, but it worked. I can reach the glowing cylinder.
  - 
  - 
  - That window looks very robust. But I bet it couldn't withstand a good explosion.
  - 
  - 
  - Nothing.
  - 
  - 
  - There's something in there... let's see... come... out!
  - 
  - 
  - I pulled nearly five meters of cable out of the wall... you can never have enough
    of that stuff!

  - Hey you! Have you seen my keys? I seem to have lost them...
  - 
  - 
  - This is the way out, right?
  - Lie low!
  - 
  - No, I did not see any keys. I swear!
  - 
  - 
  - Ok, I will turn around to look at it. But this is the last time! There better
    be a real Three-headed giraffe this time!
  - Play it cool...
  - 
  - Nope, sorry dude...
  - 
  - 
  - Look behind you! A three-headed giraffe!
  - 
  - 
  - Wait! Shouldn't you be in a cell?
  - 
  - 
  - Do you really think I'm that stupid?
  - 
  - 
  - No really! Look!
  - Just visiting!
  - 
  - Me? No, I'm just visiting.
  - Try a lie!
  - 
  - No, I'm free to go. Dr. Mansion diagnosis says - and I'm quoting here - that I'm
    not a maniac!
  - 
  - 
  - I don't really believe you. I think I'm going to get our guard.
  - 
  - 
  - Dr. Mansion doesn't work here any more young man. So...
  - 
  - 
  - Well, visiting hours are long over young man. So...
  - Don't worry, be happy!
  - 
  - Me? Treatment? No! Im fine, just superfine. I'm smiling, right?
  - Crowbar! Crowbar!
  - 
  - Treatment? Me? In a second class facility like this? Never! I'm going and I'm
    going now!
  - 
  - 
  - Oh not this word again! Can't you stop saying it? You may have a compulsion neurosis.
    I think you need treatment.
  - 
  - 
  - Second class facility? You are definitely not lucid! This is the finest hospital
    of the city!
  - 
  - 
  - Ha! Never! This is the worst place I've ever seen. Who did the decoration? A game
    designer?
  - 
  - 
  - This is an outrage! I'm going to call the guard!
  - 
  - 
  - Hey doc! You look hungry. Can I interest you in a tasty banana?
  - 
  - 
  - Oh thanks, did you know that the reason bananas are curved has to do with how
    they grow? Bananas grow in bunches known as 'hands'. As the bananas in a hand
    grow larger, they eventually curve upwards so that instead of pointing towards
    the ground, they bend up and point at the sky. This is called 'negative geotropism'.
    Bananas have this so that they can reach out towards the sun and get more light!
    Amazing, isn't it?
  - 
  - 
  - Uhm, yes really doc. Fascinating story. But they also taste very good. So enjoy
    your meal!
  - 
  - 
  - Oh yes, thanks young man. [He's eating the banana with three big bites.]
  - 
  - 
  - Well, interesting taste. But I feel very sleepy now. Did you know that the reason
    for that... [Sits down && falls asleep.]
  - 
  - 
  - '...is that the banana is full of sleeping pills. Yes doc. I actually knew that.
    Sleep well! I''m out of here!'
  - 
  - 
  - Oh I'm just visiting. You know... my old nanny. She's, well... 'Spoing' - got
    more than one screw loose - very sad actually. She played too many bad videogames
    I fear.
  - 
  - 
  - Hey, who are you?
  - 
  - 
  - Thanks for the banana. This tastes really good. Just feelin' a little slee...
  - 
  - 
  - Didn't see you coming in and visiting ours are over. I don't think you are telling
    the truth.
  - 
  - 
  - I'm not your friend sir. Step back from the parameter!
  - 
  - 
  - (You hear the guards stomach growling)
  - 
  - 
  - Well, sounds like my friend here is very hungry. I should give him something to
    eat. Something that lets him enter never-never land. But the crowbar would also
    do the trick.
  - 
  - 
  - I don't know. Mama always says that you shouldn't accept things from strangers.
    But I'm really hungry.
  - Introduce yourself...
  - 
  - Well, that can be solved easily. I'm Manfred. I'm older than I look and I really
    like kittens. As a friendly gesture I gift you this delicous banana. Enjoy your
    meal - buddy!
  - Reason with him.
  - 
  - Oh I'm not really a stranger, I'm Manfred. And I think a man in your position
    cannot risk to be weakend. Let me gift you this banana so that you may stay strong
    and vigilant!
  - 
  - 
  - Ok, I guess you're right. I accept your gift.
  - 
  - 
  - Oh, somebody is a little bit grumpy. Is it because one of your shoelaces is untied?
  - 
  - 
  - What? My shoelace is untied? Why didn't you tell me that straightaway?
  - 
  - 
  - Well, I just realized...
  - 
  - 
  - This is a high security risk! It could get me killed! Echo_01 to base. I got a
    404 here. I will initiate countermeasures immediately. Stay alert!
  - 
  - 
  - Yes, bow down. Perfect head position. Say hello to my good old pal - the crowbar!
  - 
  - 
  - That doesn't make sense yet...
  - 
  - 
  - He's gonna be fine. Just a headache when he wakes up. Time to go. Run Manfred,
    run!
  - 
  - 
  - Oh great, sleeping pills!
  - 
  - 
  - Wow, a banana. This must be my lucky day.
  - 
  - 
  - 'That''s some kind of advertisement. It says:'
  - 
  - 
  - Well... primitive paintings. Maybe kids drew them or cats? Hard to tell. Either
    way, they don't make sense.
  - 
  - 
  - It has a biohazard sticker attached. Why? I don't know. I guess for good reasons
    and that is good enough for me. I won't touch it.

  - Yes.

  - "Moral +10 or higher\n\nWow, you have a super-duper good character! Everyone who
    knows you wants to be your friend. If you encounter a kitten in a tree you don't
    hesitate to climb it up and rescue the poor animal. The only reward you seek is
    the happy smile of the owner. Helping others makes your day. You always end it
    with milk and cookies. Bon app\xE9tit!\n\n\nMoral +1 - +9\n\nYou are a kindhearted
    person and a lot of people really love you. You have hundred of friends on anticbook
    and everybody likes your posts! If you encounter a kitten in a tree you would
    not do anything stupid like risking your life by climbing up the tree, but you
    would call the authorities and make sure that the poor animal is rescued.\n\n\nMoral
    0\n\nWow, you are so neutral if you were a country you would be switzerland and
    tax fugitives would seek shelter in you. You would not pick a side even if there
    were only one side to pick. You should consider a career in politics! If you encounter
    a kitten in a tree you would do nothing but to stop and see what happens.\n\nMoral
    -1 - -14\n\nYou always search for the eays way out. Moral is for you a handicap
    of the weak. You will prevail through strength. If you encounter a kitten in a
    tree you would do nothing. Maybe it saves itself, maybe not. Either way it gets
    what it deserves and this has nothing to do with you. Only sometimes you wonder
    why nobody adds you on anticbook. \n\n\nMoral -15 or lower\n\nYou are pure evil
    and a natural born villain. Not only that you would not save a kitten in a tree,
    no, you are probably the reason why it fled up the tree in the first place. First
    time you heard about Santa as a kid you constructed a trap to catch and torture
    him to also get the other kids presents. Thank god this plan failed like all your
    other evil masterplans. Evil condemns itself (normally by telling others about
    their evil masterplans)."

  - 'Dialogue: Waking Up'
  - 
  - Overview
  - "Maniac Manfred is a classical 2D point & click adventure. The player slips into
    the role of Manfred, who awakes in a padded cell of a mental hospital without
    a clue how he got there. Obviously, his goal is to escape the madhouse as quick
    as possible. \n\nTo achieve this goal the player must find and combine items (or
    small animals) and prove his superior intelligence in epic linguistic battles
    (abbr. \"dialogues\"). In every scene the player can overcome the obstacles in
    different ways that finally lead to three morally different endings."
  - Key Facts
  - "    * <b>Genre:</b> Point & Click Adventure\n    * <b>Platform: </b>PC and IPad\n\n<b>USPs:</b>\n\n
    \   * Four different locations! \n    * Three different endings!\n    * A <color=#ffa61aff>Hamster</color>
    with telepathic powers!"
  - Game Mechanics
  - "In every scene the player can overcome the current obstacle in different ways.
    It's up to the player how ruthless he wants to be in his escape. The choices affect
    the morality rating and finally lead to three different endings. \n\nBesides that
    the gameplay is very typical for a point & click adventure: The player must find
    items and use or combine them to proceed. Furthermore Maniac Manfred has a strong
    emphasis on dialogue. Sometimes the player can even solve puzzles with the right
    dialogue choices alone."
  - GUI
  - "Maniac Manfred has the following GUI components:\n\n    * Morale value - Colored
    number in the upper left of the screen\n    * Mouse cursor - Different icon depending
    on over what the user is hovering (see <color=#ffa61aff>MouseCursorIcons</color>)\n
    \   * Inventory - Bar at the bottom of the screen listing all items in the player's
    inventory"
  - Morality Rating
  - As stated above the player's decisions influence the morality rating.
  - Controls
  - The game can be played via mouse or touch screen. In both cases the player can
    (left-)click on objects to interact with them. To use or combine items he must
    drag & drop them from the inventory to the desired target (another item in the
    inventory or an object in the scene).
  - Story
  - "<color=#ffa61aff>Manfred</color> was just a usual game designer and lived a happy
    life, until he had to create a game with a truly non-linear story. After completely
    getting lost in the branching structure of his game, he had a nervous breakdown
    and finally admitted himself to the nearest mental hospital. \n\nThe game begins
    with Manfred awaking in a padded cell of the Lucas Artsington sanitarium for the
    mentally diseased. He cannot remember the last days nor how he got where he now
    is. <color=#ffa61aff>Dr. Artie Cee</color> tries to calm him down, but Manfred
    only has one goal: Getting out of there as fast as possible."

  - Corridor

  - Lobby
  - The lobby is the first room you enter when using the main entrance to the Lucas
    Artsington Sanitarium for the Mentally Disordered. It's a rather spartan and not
    very friendly looking room. Behind the reception desk visitors are welcomed by
    a charming security guard.
